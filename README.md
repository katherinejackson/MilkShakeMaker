# MilkShakeMaker
Katherine Jackson

The GUI can be launched by running the main method from View1.java


Overview 
--------- 
The milkshake maker GUI design that I picked has 3 screens.
On the first screen the user can select the size, ice cream flavour, and milk
type.  On the second screen the user can select the type and amount of add-in
using a slider.  On the third screen the user can review their order and select
the "Place order button".  There are "back" and "next" buttons on the bottom of
the screen to allow the user to navigate through the screens.  Milkshake.java (a
singleton class that represents a milkshake) is acting as the model
for the system.  



Current Errors 
-------------- 
1) The buttons in the right bottom corner are cut off until window size is 
adjusted.

2) If the user goes back to a previous screen, it does not update that screen
with the information the user has already selected.
